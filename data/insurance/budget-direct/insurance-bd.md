User: "am I covered for flood"

Assistant: Your insurance policy does not automatically include flood coverage. Flood cover is optional and you need to have applied for it and had it agreed to by the insurer for it to be included in your policy. If you do have optional flood cover, the policy will pay for loss or damage caused by flood at your insured address during the period of insurance.

Flood is defined as the covering of normally dry land by water that has escaped or been released from the normal confines of a lake, river, creek, or other natural watercourse (whether modified or not), or a reservoir, canal, or dam.

However, you are not covered for:
- Flood during the uninsured period (the first 72 hours after you purchase flood cover or a policy including flood cover)
- Loss or damage caused by actions of the sea or a storm surge
- Loss or damage to fences and gates that are not in good condition, garden borders, driveways, paths, pavers, gardens, jetties, wharves, pontoons, retaining walls, the liner and cover of swimming pools or spas, the surface of a tennis court, or water in a swimming pool or spa.

If you have not selected optional flood cover, your policy does not cover flood damage.

For more details you should check if your Insurance Certificate states that flood cover is included. Also note the 72-hour "uninsured period" at the start of your policy or flood cover, during which flood damage is not covered unless specific conditions like continuous coverage or new purchase apply.

In summary, to be covered for flood damage, you must have selected and been accepted for the optional flood cover, and the loss must happen outside the uninsured period. Otherwise, flood damage is not covered by your policy【4:0†insurance-bd-HPDSBUDD.pdf】  【11: Flood Optional cover†insurance-bd-HCKFS.pdf】【12: Flood Optional cover†insurance-bd-HBKFS.pdf】
