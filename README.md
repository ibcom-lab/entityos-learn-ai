## Learn how to use entityOS & AI Services

**In this example:**
- A GenAI agent (as a permissioned entityOS user) is a member of conversation
- The User is alos a member of the conversation
- The code (as the GenAI agent) searches for conversation (set by UUID/GUID in the event.json) for posts that have a subject containing @genai. 
- It then passes the message to the GenAI service (in this example OpenAI)
- It then saves the response as a comment to the original post.
