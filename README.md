## Learn how to use entityOS & AI Services

In this example the node app a GenAI agent (as an entityOS user) searches for conversation (set by UUID/GUID in the event.json) that it is a participant in, for posts that have a subject containing @genai or @heyocto.  It then passes the message to the GenAI service (in this example OpenAI) and then saves the response as a comment to the original post.

Example uses OpenAI, but you can change to any service you wish.

You can also change to a Python app - using [github.com/ibcom-lab/entityos-learn-python](https://github.com/ibcom-lab/entityos-learn-python) as your starting point.
